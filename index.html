    <h2> Hi!, I am Mohammed Nouman Shariff</h2>
    <h3> Here is some basic information about me</h3>
    <p>Hello! I'm Mohammed Nouman Shariff, a fifth-year student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering at Maharaja's Institute of Technology, Mysore. Embracing the dynamic world of academia, I am immersed in the enriching environment of MIT, where I constantly strive to broaden my knowledge and skills.</br></br>

        Beyond the academic realm, my heart finds joy in the rhythmic beats of football. The football field is not just a battleground for me; it's where I unleash my passion, camaraderie, and dedication. The thrill of the game fuels my spirit and keeps me grounded.
        
        Apart from the football pitch, I am an avid creator, finding solace and excitement in bringing ideas to life. Whether it's crafting something innovative from scratch, expressing myself through vibrant strokes on a canvas, or diving into the realm of creativity, I find fulfillment in every endeavor.</br></br>
        
        In the realm of self-expression, painting is my sanctuary. The canvas becomes a playground for my imagination, where I weave stories through colors and strokes. Being creative is not just a hobby; it's an integral part of who I am.</br></br>
        
        As I navigate through the complexities of academia and pursue my passions, I am on a journey to discover, create, and leave an indelible mark on the world.</p>
